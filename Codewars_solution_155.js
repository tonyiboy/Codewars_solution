// Task
// Coding in function infiniteLoop. function accept 3 parameters. The 1st parameter is arr, 
// it's a 2D array, it contains three 1D array. The 2nd parameter is d ï¼Œit's a string. 
// The 3rd parameter is n, it's a number.
// You can think of arr as a moat, the elements of arr like water constantly flow in. 
// The direction of flow is controlled by the parameter d. The value of d can be "left" or "right". "left" 
// means the "river" moves to the left. All elements in the 1D array are to the left moving n position, if 
// beyond the bounds of the array and the element is moved to the tail on the left side of the array; if it 
// exceeds the left boundary element would be moved to the tail of 3rd array(like a circle). Right is also similar 
// to the operation, but it is moving to the right.
// Finally, return arr.
// Examples
// infiniteLoop( [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]],"left",1) should return [[2,3,4],[5,6,7],[8,9,1]]
// infiniteLoop( [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]],"right",1) should return [[9,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]
// infiniteLoop( [[1,2],[3,4,5,6],[7,8,9,10]],"left",2) should return [[3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,1,2]]

const infiniteLoop = (arr,d,n) => {
    const nums = arr.reduce((acc, v) => acc.concat(v), []);
    
    while (n--) d === 'left' ? nums.push(nums.shift()) : nums.unshift(nums.pop());
    
    return arr.map(a => Array.from({length: a.length}, () => nums.shift()));
